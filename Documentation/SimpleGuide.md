## **Part 0.** Introduce some directories and files.
  - We only need to know few directories and files under `Platform/SurfaceDuo1Pkg/`

___
## **Part 1.** Early porting and tests.
  - For example, porting uefi for meizu 16T.
    1. Search for its code name: m928q.
    2. Copy `oneplus-guacamole/` to `meizu-m928q/`. (brand-codename).
    3. Remove all files under `meizu-m928q/CustomizedBinaries` & `meizu-m928q/PatchedBinaries.`
    4. Extract files from your device's xbl and put them under CustomizedBinaries.
        + *Install 7zip on your computer.*
        + *Connect your phone to your computer and execute the command on your computer.*
          ```
          adb shell su -c "dd if=/dev/block/by-name/xbl_a of=/sdcard/xbl.img"
          ```
        + *Move `/sdcard/xbl.img` to your computer.*
        + *Right Click -> 7zip- > extract -> #:e -> 4.gz.*
        + *Decompress 4.gz and put them under `meizu-m928q/CustomizedBinaries`.*
    5. Enable MLVM in `Defines.dsc.inc` (FALSE -> TRUE)
    6. Edit resolution in `PcdFixedAtBuild.dsc.inc`.
    7. Patch your device's dxe and put them under `PatchedBinaries/`.
    8. Replace `guacamole.dtb` with `m928q.dtb` (you can find your device's dtb in `/sys/firmware/fdt`.)
    9. Build it.
    10. Test it.
        + *Connect your phone to your computer and execute it on your computer.*
          ```
          adb reboot bootloader
          fastboot boot Build/meizu-m928q/meizu-m928q_${ram-size}G.img
          ```
  - Your device will enter UEFI Shell if porting success.
  - What if it stacks, reboots or crashes ?
    * See part 3 and patch your device's firmware binaries.
___
## **Part 2.** Try to boot windows.
  *The DSDT for guacamole is the basic DSDT. It only contains USB & UFS.*
  - Setup Windows PE environment on your device.
  - Try to boot into Windows PE.
  - What if it stacks, reboots or crashes ?
    * Check UFS CCA in dsdt, it should be 0.
    * Check [MemoryMap](../Platforms/SurfaceDuo1Pkg/Include/Configuration/DeviceMemoryMap.h).
    * Check HAS_MLVM in `Defines.dsc.inc`, if windows hangs at boot, set it to `TRUE`.
  - Usb not working with external power supply?
    * Patch firmware binaries.
  *It will boot into PE if porting success.*
___
## **Part 3.** Patch binaries.
  - Which binary needs Patch ?
    * If your phone stack while loading PILDxe, patch UFSDxe.
    * If your phone can not connect with PC via KDNET, or USB not working in windows(with externel power), pacth UsbConfigDxe.
    * If your phone can not usb button in uefi stage, patch ButtonsDxe.
  - Where to patch ?
    * The most simple way to know where to pacth:
      + Find one device's original xxxDxe.efi and the pacthed xxxDxe.efi .
      + Dump hex and get where & what to patch.
        ```
        hexdump -C a_xxxDxe.efi > a.txt
        hexdump -C b_xxxDxe.efi > b.txt
        diff a.txt b.txt
        ```
        - Example: 
            * UFSDxe.efi (nabu):
            ```
            ~/mu-msmnile/Platforms/SurfaceDuo1Pkg/Device/xiaomi-nabu$ diff a.txt b.txt 
            383c383
            < 000025f0  00 00 80 52 c0 03 5f d6  fd 7b 03 a9 fd c3 00 91  |...R.._..{......|
            ---
            > 000025f0  ff 03 01 d1 f4 4f 02 a9  fd 7b 03 a9 fd c3 00 91  |.....O...{......|
            913c913
            < 00004710  20 00 80 52 c0 03 5f d6  fd 43 00 91 e8 7b 00 32  | ..R.._..C...{.2|
            ---
            > 00004710  ff 83 00 d1 fd 7b 01 a9  fd 43 00 91 e8 7b 00 32  |.....{...C...{.2|
            ```
    * How to patch ?
      + Now you know the difference addr is `0x000025f0` and `0x00004710`.
      + Open the two efi files in IDA (or other tools), find the function near `0x000025f0` and `0x00004710`.
      + See which instructions were modified.
      + Open your device's xxxDxe.efi in IDA.
      + Find the same function(s).
      + Apply the same patch for your device's xxxDxe.efi .
      + Put the patched binaries under `PatchedBinaries/`.
      + Check DXE_Spec.inc for the paths to your device's patched binaries.
